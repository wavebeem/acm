Friends

description

These days, you can do all sorts of things online. For example, you can use various websites to make virtual friends. For some people, growing their social network (their friends, their friends' friends, their friends' friends' friends, and so on), has become an addictive hobby. Just as some people collect stamps, other people collect virtual friends. Your task is to observe the interactions on such a website and keep track of the size of each person's network. Assume that every friendship is mutual. If Fred is Barney's friend, then Barney is also Fred's friend.
